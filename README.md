# pcsrun

PCS m68k partial syscall emulator for PCS Cadmus Munix.
This contains enough code to allow common compile tools like
cc, ld, yacc, lex in order to verify the original files and rebuilt
sources.

This directory moved from pcs-munix.

This is work-in-progress code. No warranty at all. Not a piece of art, 
and never intended to be reference code for teaching C++ programming.
Take it or leave it.
